This project aims to develop an intelligent system for automatically summarizing meta review data associated with academic papers. Leveraging the power of a pre-trained Generative AI Language Model (GenAI LLM), the system streamlines the process of distilling essential insights from meta reviews, providing users with concise summaries.

### Key Components:
Pre-Trained GenAI LLM:
    Utilizes an open-source GenAI LLM model for language understanding and generation.
    The pre-trained model forms the foundation for fine-tuning to enhance its proficiency in summarizing meta review content.
    
Fine-Tuning Process:
  Employs fine-tuning techniques to adapt the pre-trained GenAI LLM to the specific domain of academic meta reviews.
  Enhances model accuracy and coherence through iterative training on the provided dataset.
